\item \textbf{Save User Preference:}\\Service contract requires to save different preferences to a specific user when all Pre-Conditions are met. In this test, A discovery was made whereby the request overrides already existing preferences instead of appending new preferences or throw an exception if preference is used. This thus leads to it not fully fulfilling the service contract stipulated.\\

\item \textbf{Cache Routes:}\\MongoDB as a choice of database management is favourable especially with regards scalability. However, the location data is not stored in a MongoDB database but rather in the same navigationLocal.js file as the entire program. This will cause a bottleneck when the amount of location data is increased.\\
