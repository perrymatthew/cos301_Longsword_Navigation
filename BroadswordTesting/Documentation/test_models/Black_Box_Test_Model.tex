\subsection{Black Box Test Model}

The steps that were taken in order to get the code running were as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Install Node, MongoDB and NSQ
\item Update the Node Package Manager to the latest version
\item Run the code located in the root folder
\end{enumerate}


After the code was run all of the JSON string variables were displayed on the terminal.
The output showed all of the routes that were added to the mongo database along with various text describing interactions between the java script code, node and mongo db.
At this current stage without having analysed the code, the output seems very cluttered,
unformatted and it was difficult to identify major points from all of the text (excluding the JSON output).
Focusing on the JSON string outputs however, everything seemed to be in order with regards to what is expected from the navigation module.
The script ran through once and was then terminated thus, there was no persistent server (apart from the mongo database storage where the routes are stored and edited).
