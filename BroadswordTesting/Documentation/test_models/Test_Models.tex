\section{Test Models}

In order to test the broadsword navigation team’s code two test models were used, the Black Box and White Box testing models.
These two models allow for a fully comprehensive testing environment as each will cover different aspects of depth in the program.
To start, the Black Box testing model will be used. With this testing model method the program will be run without analysing at any of the code
and the output will be evaluated based on what was expected from the navigation module. After this step the White Box testing model will be used.
In this model the code will be examined thoroughly and compared to the corresponding output received when running the program in the Black Box test.
With this testing model in mind different aspects of the program can be tested for as each looks at the expected output from different perspectives.
