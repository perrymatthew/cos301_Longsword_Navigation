        \item \textbf{Efficiency:}
				Functionality could be extended (by use of more test cases) to enhance
				the efficiency of this module.
				The module is effective as it stands, but resources such as time and
				other technologies could have been used more effectively to enhance the
				non-functional requirement of compliance.
